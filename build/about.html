                I am a Department of Energy Computational Sciences Graduate Fellow and current Ph.D. candidate in the Princeton University Department of Astrophysical Sciences.
                I use simulations to understand the physics of transients, a class of astrophysical phenomena which change brightness over human timescales (< years) such as supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and compact object mergers.
                These energetic events often produce multi-messenger signals i.e. electromagnetic radiation, gravitational radiation, cosmic rays.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current decade promises to be a golden age of transient astronomy, with new instruments like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
                Simulations are an excellent tool for understanding how these events work because they often involved coupled non-linear physics.
                One of my main research interests is tidal disruption events (TDEs), where a star is torn apart by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH).
                Recently, I've also done work on galaxy formation at Cosmic Dawn and electron thermalization in kilonovae ejecta.

                Outside of research, I am a triathlete and a jazz pianist.

                    I grew up in Evanston, IL just North of Chicago where I attended Evanston Township High School (ETHS).
                    During my junior and senior years at ETHS, I worked with Alexander "Sasha" Tchekhovskoy (Northwestern University) to analyze simulations of TDEs in the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10192">H-AMR</a>.
                    I presented this work as posters at the 2018 and 2019 Blue Waters Symposium for Petascale Science and Beyond and as an invited talk at the 19th meeting of the High Energy Astrophysics Division.

                    I did undergrad at Yale University, where I studied physics and also took courses in anthropology and world literature.
                    During my first and second years, I worked in Nir Navon's <a href="https://uqm.yale.edu/">Ultracold Quantum Matter Lab</a> building an apparatus to cool Strontium atoms to ultra-cold temperatures for use in optical tweezer experiments.
                    However, I ultimately returned to astronomy, continuing my work with Sasha Tchekhovskoy.
                    This resulted in a first-author publication on energy dissipation in TDEs and a co-author publication on accretion in thin misaligned disks.
                    In my final year, I continued my work with Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz from the previous summer under the mentorship of Priya Natarajan for my senior thesis.
                    Simultaneously, I was the president of the <a href="https://yaleaerospace.org/">Yale Undergraduate Aerospace Association</a>, the largest undergraduate engineering organization on campus.
                    I lead the development of a cosmic ray detector for a CubeSat satellite and managed many other projects.

                    During the summer after my third year of undergrad, I worked with Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz (UCSC) at the <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/">Lamat Institute</a> REU program to develop an analytic model for double-peaked Balmer line emission optical line emission in TDEs.
                    I continued this work during my final year at Yale under the mentorship of Priya Natarajan.
                    I presented this work as a poster at the 241st meeting of the American Astronomical Society and the 20th meeting of the High Energy Astrophysics Division.

                    I am currently a Ph.D. student at Princeton University in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences.
                    In my first project, I worked with Romain Teyssier to simulate star formation in massive galaxies at cosmic dawn (z ~ 9) using the cosmological hydrodynamics code RAMSES.
                    I am currently working with Eliot Quataert to develop an analytic model for the nozzle shock in tidal disruption events.
